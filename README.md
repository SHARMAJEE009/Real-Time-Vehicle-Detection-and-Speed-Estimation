# Real-Time-Vehicle-Detection-and-Speed-Estimationï‚·Developed a system to detect, track, and estimate vehicle speed in real-time from video footage using OpenCV and Dlib.
#Implemented robust vehicle tracking with Dlib's correlation tracker and accurate speed estimation through pixel displacement and frame rate calculation.
#Ensured real-time performance and seamless video output, displaying speed information on the video feed.
